## Why ?

Lots of teams just fails to make openapi generate what they needs.
At the end, either you deal with a weird api, or spend weeks on trying to customize the beast.
Even with the myriad of fake choices, OpenApi is just a bundle of fake promises.

What i saw :
- Real poor generated code.
- The yaml definition not fit most simples needs.
- They spend too much effort to brings useless languages that most dev will never use.
- It adds lots of garbage dependencies, even in release build
- If you choose custom templates, it sure gives you nightmare and unmaintainable stuff.
- If you choose custom generators, just add another project to maintain. If you succeed to extend it the way you want.
